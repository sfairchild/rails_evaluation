### Story tasks

#### Story 1

As a user, I want to ensure that when a `List` and an `Item` are created, they are valid.

A valid `list` meets the following criteria.

1. It has a `name`
2. It has a `description`
3. It's `description` is longer than 5 characters

A valid `item` meets the following criteria.

1. It has a `name`

#### Story 2

As a user, I want my items to be sorted alphabetically when I view a list.

Test 1: In the list show page. Ensure the items are displayed in ascending order

Bonus Test:(Not required, but if you have time give it a shot) Create a toggle to change between ascending and descending order.

~~Story 3~~

~~***Bonus - ___complete only if you have time___***~~

~~As a user, I would like to create tags on items. Items can have multiple tags and tags can belong to multiple items. For this exercise we will use a predefined list of tags. You can use the seed file for creating you list. Your tags will be ['important', 'nice to have', 'idea', 'task']~~

~~Test 1. When I create a new item, allow me to assign tags with a list of checkboxes.~~

~~Test 2. After an item is created, list the tags next to the item name.~~
